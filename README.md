##Project Description
A mobile application developed for the Canadian Disaster Animal Response Team (CDART) as part of the RED Academy Community Partnership program.
This app is intended to be used as a central hub for CDART volunteers to access learning resources, key forms and procedures, and training materials,
as well as for pet owners to share information about their pets that can be used by CDART volunteers to facilitate animal rescue in disaster scenarios.
